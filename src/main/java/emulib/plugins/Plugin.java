/**
 * Plug-in main interface. The interface methods are available only to emuStudio. Plug-ins communicate between
 * each other using special entities called "contexts".
 *
 * CONTRACT:
 *
 * Each plug-in must meet several requirements:
 *
 *   - this interface, or its derivate, must be implemented by one and only one class (so-called "main-class")
 *   - the main class has to be annotated with @PluginType annotation with required parameters
 *   - the main class has to have single constructor with two parameters.
 *
 * The constructor signature must be as follows:
 *
 *     SamplePlugin(Long pluginId, ContextPool contextPool) {
 *         ...
 *     }
 *
 * 1. pluginId is a unique plug-in identification. Various emuLib operations (like reading plug-in settings) require
 *    pluginId as input argument.
 *
 * 2. contextPool represents a pool of communication entities called "contexts". Contexts represent plug-in API intended
 *    for the communication with other plug-ins.
 *
 * Plug-ins should initialize and register the contexts they provide into the contextPool within the plug-in constructor.
 *
 * Plug-ins must not try to obtain other context from the contextPool within the constructor. For this purpose there
 * exists the initialize() method.
 *
