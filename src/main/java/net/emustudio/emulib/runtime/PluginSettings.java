 * The class provides methods for reading/writing plugin settings.

 * method.

 * A setting is a <code>(key, value)</code> pair. Keys and values are Strings.
 * <p>
 * Key format must be a single word, without spaces. Plugin keys must not start with <code>"emustudio_"</code> prefix.
 * This prefix is reserved for emuStudio settings and might be overridden by emuStudio.
