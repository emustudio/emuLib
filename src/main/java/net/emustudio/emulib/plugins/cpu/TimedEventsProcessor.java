/**
 * Timed events processing is a soft real-time system based on a logical system clock,
 * interpreted as number of passed CPU cycles.
 * <p>
 * Events (Runnable objects) are scheduled to be run every given cycles. Scheduling events is a
 * thread-safe operation, so any device can register an event handler (= schedule an event) from
 * any thread.
 * <p>
 * CPU is responsible for advancing the clock after each executed instruction
 * (see {@link TimedEventsProcessor#advanceClock(int) advanceClock} method),
 * which is supposed to be run on the CPU emulator thread. The events which passed their deadline
 * are then triggered on the same thread (CPU thread).
 * <p>
 * The event "deadline" is a number of cycles passed from current executed number of cycles. So events can
 * be scheduled to run e.g. every 5 cycles.
 * <p>
 * If the CPU supports timed events processing, it should return an instance of this class in the
 * {@link CPUContext#getTimedEventsProcessor() getTimedEventsProcessor} method.
