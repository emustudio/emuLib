/**
 * Context is a functional structure of a plugin that can be used by the other plugins.
 *
 * plugins obtain needed contexts of another plugins by querying ContextPool directly. plugins must be interconnected
 * and compatible to get the contexts.
 *
 * Each plugin can implement none, one or more contexts, implementing the same interface is allowed. plugin can
 * declare new context interface, which would be derived (directly or indirectly) from this interface.
 * 
 * Another requirement is to annotate context interfaces with @ContextType annotation.
 * 
 * Contexts are required to be thread-safe, since there's no guarantee in which threads plugins communicate.
