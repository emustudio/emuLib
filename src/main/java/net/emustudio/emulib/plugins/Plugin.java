 * Plugin main interface. This interface is available only to emuStudio, not to other plugins. Plugins communicate
 * with each other using special entities called "contexts".
 * <p>
 * CONTRACT:
 * <p>
 * Each plugin must meet several requirements:
 * <p>
 * - this interface, or its derivative, must be implemented by one and only one class (so-called "root class")
 * - the root class has to be annotated with {@link net.emustudio.emulib.plugins.annotations.PluginRoot} annotation
 * with required parameters
 * - the root class has to have single constructor with two parameters.
 * <p>
 * The constructor signature must be as follows:
 *
 * <code>
 * \@PluginRoot(...)
 * SamplePlugin(Long pluginId, EmuStudio emustudio) {
 * ...
 * }
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * 1. pluginId is a unique plugin identification. Various emuLib operations (like reading plugin settings) require
 * pluginId as input argument.
 * <p>
 * 2. emuStudio is the main API used for communication with emuStudio and other plugins.
 * <p>
 * Plugins should initialize and register the contexts they provide into the {@link EmuStudio#getContextPool()} in the
 * constructor. {@link net.emustudio.emulib.runtime.ContextPool} is a container which contains contexts of all plugins.
 * <p>
 * Plugins must not try to obtain other context(s) from the contextPool in the constructor, because the order of context
 * registration is fixed. In order to obtain plugin contexts, {@link Plugin#initialize(PluginSettings)} should be used.
