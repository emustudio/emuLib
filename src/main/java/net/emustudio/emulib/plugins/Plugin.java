/**
 * Plugin main interface. This interface is available only to emuStudio, not to other plugins. Plugins communicate
 * with each other using special entities called "contexts".
 * <p>
 * CONTRACT:
 * <p>
 * Each plugin must meet several requirements:
 * <p>
 * - this interface, or its derivative, must be implemented by one and only one class (so-called "root class")
 * - the root class has to be annotated with {@link net.emustudio.emulib.plugins.annotations.PluginRoot} annotation
 * with required parameters
 * - the root class has to have single constructor with 3 parameters (see below).
 * <p>
 * The constructor signature has to look like this:
 *
 * <code>
 * \@PluginRoot(...)
 * SamplePlugin(long pluginId, ApplicationApi emustudio, PluginSettings settings) {
 * ...
 * }
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * 1. <code>pluginId</code> is a unique plugin identification. Operations around plugin contexts require it as input argument.
 * <p>
 * 2. <code>emustudio</code> is the API provided by emuStudio application, to be used by plugins.
 * <p>
 * 3. <code>settings</code> plugin's settings. A plugin can use it for reading/writing its custom settings. Updated settings
 * are saved immediately in the configuration file, in the same thread.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Plugins should register the contexts they provide into the {@link net.emustudio.emulib.runtime.ContextPool},
 * which can be obtained from {@link ApplicationApi} API.
 * <p>
 * Plugins must not try to obtain contexts from the context pool from plugin constructor. The reason is that the order
 * of plugin context registration is fixed, and in the plugin construction time some contexts don't need to be available
 * yet. Plugin contexts can be safely obtained within {@link Plugin#initialize()} method.
