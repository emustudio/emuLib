/**
 * Plugin main interface. This interface is available only to emuStudio, not to other plugins. Plugins communicate
 * with each other using special entities called "contexts".
 *
 * CONTRACT:
 *
 * Each plugin must meet several requirements:
 *
 *   - this interface, or its derivate, must be implemented by one and only one class (so-called "main-class")
 *   - the main class has to be annotated with @PluginType annotation with required parameters
 *   - the main class has to have single constructor with two parameters.
 *
 * The constructor signature must be as follows:
 *
 *     SamplePlugin(Long pluginId, EmuStudioAPI emustudioAPI) {
 *         ...
 *     }
 *
 * 1. pluginId is a unique plugin identification. Various emuLib operations (like reading plugin settings) require
 *    pluginId as input argument.
 *
 * 2. emustudioAPI is the main API used for communication with emuStudio and other plugins.
 *
 * Plugins should initialize and register the contexts they provide into the {@link EmuStudio#getContextPool()} in the
 * constructor. Context pool is a container which contains contexts of all plugins.
 *
 * Plugins must not try to obtain other context(s) from the contextPool in the constructor, becasue the order of context
 * registration is fixed. In order to obtain plugin contexts, {@link Plugin#initialize(PluginSettings)} should be used.
