 * Memory context

 * type, thus a "byte", as the lowest addressable unit, is not enforced.

 * The memory context must be extended in a memory plugin in order to support additional functionality (e.g. bank-switching
 * or memory-mapped I/O).
 * <p>
 * Memory context supports annotations - a possibility to annotate any memory cell with supplemental information. Usual
 * annotations are: breakpoints, text information, position in source code, or any custom annotation. Annotation API
 * is accessible by using {@link #annotations()} method.
